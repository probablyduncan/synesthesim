# synesthesim
Simple Java text-to-color app

I made this in 2020, during the first Covid lockdown.
<br><br>
It simulates the effects of my color-grapheme synesthesia. Each letter corresponds to a different color, and, when typed, that color appears.
<br><br>
It could be made more complex, and I might do more with it in the future, but probably not anytime soon.
<br><br>
The folder contains the source files, and synesthesim.jar is the program itself.
